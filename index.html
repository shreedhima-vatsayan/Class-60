        <h1>HI!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>My hobby is reading interesting, suspensful as well as fantasy books. My favourite books are the Harry Potter Series, Percy Jackson Series, With Love From The Hills ~ Ruskin Bond, Malgudi Days, 5 Mystery Stories, Sherlock Holmes, Arabian Nights, Sindbad The Sailor. Reading books helps me in improving my vocabulary and it is also a great way to spend time. My favourite time to read books are when its raining and when there is sun during the winter season. Otherwise, I read books while I sit on my couch. This also helps me improve my imagination. This has helped me when I write stories, when I speak in fornt of many people, when there is a random topic given and you have to speak on it.</p><br>
        <h4>Hi!<br>Try the books mentioned above. They are really good.</h4>
